    "text": "I studied mainly math&science in high school. Also I wanted to be a businessman. I believed in that this could happen by study business. Therefore, I choose to study International Trade&Management at Yeditepe University as a full scholarship student in 2014. This is one of my big mistakes. I completed an amazing english prep-school in my first year of university. However, I was disappointed after completed one year in the faculty because of the course contents. To continue my letter, I should say that I see Steve Jobs as my role model. After disappointment, I decided to educate myself based on my interests like Steve Jobs. This is one of my good decisions. I attended to other faculties’ lessons like, calculus, algebra, data structures as a guest student. Also, I used open sources to read, listen and learn about global trends. A lot of articles, business professionals pointed out big data, data analytics, machine learning and AI. I aimed to learn more things about these disciplines. In addition to my theoretic works, I worked for Shell Turkey and Dünya Varlık as a long term intern for 1.5 years in total. All of lessons, internship experiments and learnings added vision to me, also added one semester to my university life. After a short delay, I graduated from university in July 2020. My work journey started with Shell Turkey in 2018 as an Intern. My project was collecting data from Investment models and creating a readable and writeable a data lake with collected data. Thanks to this project, I learnt data literacy principles. After completed my project, I started to work for Dünya Varlık as a Intern and promoted to part-time Treasury Analyst in 2019. In my Internship, I observed treasury operations, cash-flow models. In my treasury analyst period, I built a Excel, VBA based mini ERP system for treasury operations with treasury director. Also, I develop cash flow model. My ERP and modeling project was very appreciated so, I was promoted to the junior data analyst in analytics team by CEO. In my junior period, I had chance to learn SQL. After graduation I started to work full time and built data driven collection strategies. Last in Dünya Varlık, I completed a project that aimed to predict who, when and how much pays in 10 years as a head analyst. The project sponsored by CEO and Experian was consultant company. After completed project, I decided to work for a global company. Therefore I changed my work and I have been working for ING Turkey since march 2022. I am responsible for collection strategies development and implementation. You can easily reach my LinkedIn page in this link.\nIn my special life, I am a Sudoku hunter. I believe in cause and effect which is represented by Sudoku\n\n\n\nSamurai sudoku puzzles consist of five overlapping sudoku grids."
